How to win at Connect 4 
1. Win is always possible assuming you go first and play in center column, if both players make perfect moves
2. Play in center column as often as possible, since any connect four that is not vertical has to use a checker from the center column, so if you control most of it itâ€™s very hard for opponent to get a connect four
3. Look moves ahead as soon as opponent gets two in a row
4. Watch out for game ending spaces, and never play directly below this space
5. Have two threats- one where opponent blocks to a win and one where you just win, like by making a seven shape so finishing the horizontal or diagonal connect four on the right are two spaces on top of each other
